To-do App is a React-built to-do list that was designed with SASS, stores data with Firebase, and uses React Icons and a React Custom Checkbox.

- Enter your todo item into the input box and click the search icon to add it to the list
- The amount of list items you have in your list is printed at the bottom
- The sun icon toggles the page from dark-mode to light-mode, and vice-versa 
- Feel free to refresh or close the page and the data will remain stored 
- Stylized using SASS
- Integrated Firestore to maintain data 

## How To Use

Type your to-do item into the input box, and then click on the red (+) sign to add your item to the list. Click the blank ( ) next to your list item to indicate that your to-do list item is complete. Press the trash icon that corresponds with your list item to delete that item from the list.

Additionally, in the top right you'll see a symbol of a sun; clicking that will toggle the webpage design between dark and light.
